<h1>What does it do?</h1>
My-Story is a application I created. My-Story allows you to generate user stories.<br>
You can choose the user, the goal, and the reason; It will look something like this: "As a <user> I want to do <goal> so that <reason>."<br>
<h1>How do I use it</h1>
When it is opened a window will open. The window contains three textboxes and a button.<br>
The user, goal, and reason; are in there. The user is at "User" by default.<br>
